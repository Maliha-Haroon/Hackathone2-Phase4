# Phase IV Deployment Plan

This project follows a Spec-Driven, Manifest-First deployment approach.

- Dockerfiles prepared for frontend and backend
- Kubernetes manifests structured as Helm templates
- AI-assisted DevOps workflow designed using kubectl-ai and kagent
- System ready for deployment on any Kubernetes cluster

Due to hardware limits, deployment is demonstrated through infrastructure manifests instead of a live cluster.
